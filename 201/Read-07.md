# Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

   -it provides a basis for understanding and designing systems for maintainability, testability, and incremental development

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

-table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques, which will cause the code to be harder to write, maintain, and debug


2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

- article-element specifies independent, self-contained content

- details-element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in, like a sidebar

- aside-Defines content aside from the page content


### Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

-It is aspecial function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class.


2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

-Objects created using object literals are singletons. This means when a change is made to the object, it affects that object across the entire script. Object defined with a function constructor let us have multiple instances of that object. This means change made to one instance, will not affect other instances

#### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

   -an object can inherit properties of another object. The object from where the properties are inherited is called the prototype

   -an engineer could creat a building by provide a small display with playdo would be a protype
